			<h2>What is Bulgogi?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>It is one of the most well-known Korean traditional foods, originating from the Goguryeo era. The cooking method of Bulgogi evolved over time and varies by region.</li>
				<li>While it is primarily marinated with soy sauce, sugar and Korean pear juice in most occasions, in rare places, it is only seasoned with salt to bring out the taste of the natural meat flavour.</li>
				<li>It can be cooked with vegetables over the stove (in a wok) or it can be cooked on a char-grill on its own. They will give slightly different flavours as you can imagine.</li>

				<p><li>Remove the blood from the meat with kitchen paper. (This can be done by placing the kitchen paper on the cutting board. Then put one slice of meat and layer another piece kitchen paper on top of the meat. Gently press it down to soak up the blood.) Place the meat into a large mixing bowl for marinating.</li></p>

				<p><li>Pour the marinade sauce into the bowl and mix well with the meat. Add the sesame oil and gently mix it into the meat. (I prefer adding the sesame oil separately as opposed to mixing it in marinade sauce. I read somewhere that the oil can prevent the other sauce getting absorbed effectively into the meat.) Cover the bowl with food wrap (or move the meat into a glass container with a lid) and marinate the meat for at least 4 hours in the fridge. (If you have more time, you can also marinate it overnight for an extra enhanced flavour).</li></p>

				<p><li>Prepare the vegetables. Thinly slice the onion, carrots and  green onion.</li>
				<p><img class="directions" src="https://koreankitchen-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bulgogi-vegetable.jpg" /></p>
				<p><li>Preheat the wok/skillet on the stove on medium high heat and once heated add the cooking oil and spread it well with a spatula.</li></p>
				<p><li>Add the meat and vegetables and stir. Cook them on high heat for 3 to 5 mins until the meat is starting to turn brown. Stir occasionally (every 30 seconds) and reduce the heat gradually as the meat & vegetables cook.</li></p>

				<p><li> When the meat is nearly cooked toss in the sesame seeds. By now the heat should be very low. Stir them quickly and turn off the heat.</li></p>
